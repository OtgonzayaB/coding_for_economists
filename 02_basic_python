# Have a look at logical statements
print(2 == 2) #True
print(2 == 3) #False

# Check if True and 1 are in fact equal
print(True == 1) #True

# True evaluates to 1 and False evaluates to 0.
print(True + True + False)

# Check equivalence of two variables
a = "Hi"
b = "Hello"
print(a == b)

# Multiple logical statements
print(2 == 2 and 3 == 3) #True
print(2 == 2 and 3 == 4) #False
